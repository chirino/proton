== Build Instructions ==

The following prerequesuites are required to do a full build. If you
do not wish to build a given language binding you can ommit the -devel
package for that language:

  # required dependencies
  yum install gcc cmake libuuid-devel

  # dependencies needed for ssl support
  yum install openssl-devel

  # dependencies needed for bindings
  yum install swig python-devel ruby-devel php-devel

From the directory where you found this README file:

  mkdir build
  cd build

  # Depending on your system you may want to adjust the install prefix
  # and/or adjust the lib dir.
  #
  # cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR=lib64 ..
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

  make install

Note that all installed files are stored in the install_manifest.txt file.
