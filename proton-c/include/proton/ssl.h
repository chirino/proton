/** @file
 * API for using SSL with the Transport Layer.
 *
 * A Transport may be configured to use SSL for encryption and/or authentication.  A
 * Transport can be configured as either an "SSL client" or an "SSL server".  An SSL
 * client is the party that proactively establishes a connection to an SSL server.  An SSL
 * server is the party that accepts a connection request from a remote SSL client.
 *
 * If either an SSL server or client needs to identify itself with the remote node, it
 * must have its SSL certificate configured (see ::pn_ssl_set_credentials()).
 *
 * If either an SSL server or client needs to verify the identity of the remote node, it
 * must have its database of trusted CAs configured (see ::pn_ssl_set_trusted_ca_db()).
 *
 * An SSL server may allow peers to connect without SSL (eg. "in the clear"), see
 * ::pn_ssl_allow_unsecured_client().
 *
 * The level of verification required of the remote may be configured (see
 * ::pn_ssl_set_peer_authentication, ::pn_ssl_get_peer_authentication).
